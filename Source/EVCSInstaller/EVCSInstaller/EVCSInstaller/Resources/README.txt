SETTINGS.EVDF - FILE LAYOUT DOCUMENT
=========================================================
The file 'settings.evdf' is used to store important settings which dictate the maximum amount of entries that can be loaded into the program at one time.
This can be changed to either a higher or lower value, depending on how many records you will end up using (you can always change it later.)
Setting these numbers too high can impact performance, however, so don't go overboard.
