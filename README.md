#### <u>To Do:</u> *(Cleared as of 16/7/19)*

- [ ] ================================ STRETCH GOALS ================================
- [ ] Create more secure method of encryption than a +7 cypher.
- [ ] Add the ability to click+drag on the window panels and move them around (this is a problem with the way the windows are designed and not VB or Windows.) This will need to be done for every form.
- [ ] Add "Management" form (Admin only) which will allow for exporting data files with information to email.
- [ ] Send Invoice from hire form once complete? Very, Very long term stretchy goal
- [ ] Also, fix the quantity
