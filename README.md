# EventSolutions Catalogue System

#### A (*less*) simple inventory system written in *VB.NET :(*

(shut up, it works, okay?)

> **<u>Installation</u>**
>
> There isn't a packaged executable yet, as the solution is still in (very) early development.
>
> If you want to see what is currently working, you'll need Visual Studio 2015 and a file in `*%appdata%\EventSolutions\userstore\*` called "userstore.txt". An example file has been included in `\source\example_userstore.txt`. Don't try to read the file - It uses my **super advanced** encryption method (its actually just a +7 cypher but that's our little secret okay?)
>
> Once you have the setup completed, you should be able to run the solution and log in with the default credentials, `user` and `password`.
