EventSolutions Catalogue System

#### A (*less*) simple inventory system written in *VB.NET :(*

"it kind of works"

> **<u>Installation</u>**
>
> There isn't a packaged executable yet, as the solution is still in (very) early development.
>
> If you want to see what is currently working, you'll need Visual Studio 2015 and a file in `*%appdata%\EventSolutions\userstore\*` called "userstore.txt". An example file has been included in `\source\example_userstore.txt`. Don't try to read the file - It uses my **super advanced** encryption method (which is definitely **very good and secure**)
>
> Once you have the setup completed, you should be able to run the solution and log in with the default credentials, `user` and `password`.

#### <u>To Do:</u> *(Cleared as of 16/7/19)*

- [ ] ================================ STRETCH GOALS ================================
- [ ] Create more secure method of encryption than a +7 cypher.
- [ ] Add the ability to click+drag on the window panels and move them around (this is a problem with the way the windows are designed and not VB or Windows.) This will need to be done for every form.
- [ ] Add "Management" form (Admin only) which will allow for exporting data files with information to email.
- [ ] Send Invoice from hire form once complete? Very, Very long term stretchy goal
- [ ] Also, fix the quantity
